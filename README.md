## Prediction of the housing status based on the rental information of 1003 Airbnb houses in April

Through this research, I found that based on Airbnb's merchant rental information, through logistic models based on 15 variables. The most influential state is often the corresponding rental status information of the merchant in the past. Time period is relevant. The prediction results of in sample and out sample have reached an accuracy rate of more than 70%, which seems acceptable. I then continued to conduct further research on the impact of time, price, and region on the state of housing rental. It was found that the state of house rental is significantly related to the price of rent. The higher the price of the house, the more likely it is that the house is in a block state, and the price of rent is largely affected by the region. At the same time, businesses are more inclined to block the house on Tuesdays. Further research on the block status of houses in the region found that it seems that some specific areas are more prone to block status, and these areas are often some areas with higher rent prices, which is in line with the previous findings of Price and Status research. The final conclusion from this paper is that the rental status of houses is largely affected by time, area, and rent, and there is a great correlation between rent and area. Through the model in this study, tenants can better understand the future rental status of the house, so that they can better choose a suitable house.
